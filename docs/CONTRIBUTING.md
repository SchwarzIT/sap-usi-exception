# How to contribute
## Inherited rules
The rules listed in the [CONTRIBUTING.md of our main repository][USI_CONTRIBUTING] also apply here. 

This file just adds project specific rules to that baseline.

## Please use "Oldschool ABAP"
The component is used by various USI developments and some of them need to be kept backwards compatible to virtually any SAP version.

This means that new functions introduced with ABAP 7.4 are off limits for this project.

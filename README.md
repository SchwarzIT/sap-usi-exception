# USI Exception
## Purpose
The component offers an extensible text getter API that can be used to convert exception texts into various common formats such as BAPIRET2 or SYMSG.

It additionally contains our root exception class, that will be reused by all USI developments.

## Installation Guide
This component has no dependencies and no special authorizations are required.
But as we are developing in our own namespace, you should consider [this][HOW_TO_PULL].

## How to contribute
